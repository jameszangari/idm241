    <h2>OVERVIEW</h2>
    <p>In a timeline of roughly nine weeks, I was challenged with designing and developing <strong>three</strong> fully responsive microinteractions (<em>simple</em>, <em>medium</em>, and <em>complex</em>) for "IDM 241: Microinteractions" at Drexel University, with the intent of incorporating them into full-fledged project(s) down the road. In my case, I would be adding them to my <a href="https://jamescliff.com" class="links">personal portfolio website</a> using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>

    <h2>CONTEXT & CHALLENGE</h2>
    <p>The goal of this project was to develop predictive and enjoyable interactive designs based on the consideration of users’ experience. We were tasked with identifying and implementing the elements required to create memorable digital experiences. We were free to choose the original interface we wanted to improve, and the type of interaction we wanted to occur based on the <em>Microinteracions Model</em>:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>a Trigger</li>
            <li>the Rules</li>
            <li>Feedback</li>
            <li>Loops/Modes</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>PROCESS AND INSIGHT</h2>
    <p>My personal portfolio website contatins buttons and links to my social media profiles, however they have very minimal feedback to user as of now.</p>
    <p>The first microinteraction &#8211; <strong>Alpha</strong>:</p>
    <p>My website currently has 6 social media buttons at the bottom of the page. These are the platforms I have the most presence on, so I wanted to interaction with these icons to have meaning by making a connection with the user. Upon hovering, each icon will change color depending on the color palette of the app (i.e. Spotify: green, Twitter: blue, Instagram: pink, etc.). This will help the user visualize where clicking this button will take them and enhance their interaction with this portion of the site.</p>

    <img src="./images/alpha.gif" class="image">
    <span class="imageCaption"><strong>Alpha Microinteraction</strong> Redesign</span>
    <p class="pUnderImg">The aim behind this interaction was to enhance the experience behind hovering these icons and visually show the user where it will take them, based off of familiar color palettes. The challenge behind this microinteraction was figuring out the best practice for switching image states on hover without having to use other coding languages to recolor the image along with a creating a shape around the image.</p>

    <h2>PROCESS AND INSIGHT</h2>
    <p>The second microinteraction &#8211; <strong>Beta</strong>:</p>
    <p>My website also currently has 8 social media buttons in the <strong>Portfolio</strong> section of the site. These are all of the platforms I have connections with where users can view my content. Once again, upon hovering each icon will change color depending on the color palette of the app (i.e. Spotify: green, Apple Music: gray, SoundCloud: orange, etc.). This will help the user visualize where clicking this button will take them and enhance their interaction with this portion of the site.</p>
    <h4>PROCESS: IMAGES</h4>

    <img src="./images/beta.gif" class="image">
    <span class="imageCaption"><strong>Beta Microinteraction</strong> Redesign</span>
    <p class="pUnderImg">This interaction was also focused on enhancing the experience behind hovering these icons and visually show the user where it will take them, based off of familiar color palettes and a playful animation. The challenges behind this microinteraction included:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>changing the color of the icon while hovering over the entire button, instead of just the Spotify icon</li>
        <li>making the text disappear on initial load and to slide in from the right side on time with the hover</li>
        <li>having the shake effect apply to both the icon and text, as well as being on time with the hover</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>PROCESS AND INSIGHT</h2>
    <p>The third microinteraction &#8211; <strong>Final</strong>:</p>
    <p>Currently, my website has no means of navigation. All of the content is presented on one page with external pages (upon clicking images) for sections such as Digital Media, Short Films, and Photography. This microinteraction aims to make finding content easier.</p>
    <h4>PROCESS: IMAGES</h4>

    <span class="imageCaption"><strong>Final Microinteraction</strong> Redesign</span>
    <p class="pUnderImg">The goal of adding a hamburger menu to my site was to create quick and easy navigation to get to the different sections, while retaining the layout and style of the site. The challenge behind this microinteraction was creating a unique hamburger animation with a visually pleasing, simplistic navigation menu that matched the look and feel of the current website design.</p>

    <h2>SOLUTION</h2>
    <p>The goal of this project was to revamp the elements that already exist within my personal portfolio website by adding microinteractions that are engaging for the user and positively contribute to the look-and-feel of the website.</p>

    <h2>RESULTS</h2>
    <p>The designed microinteractions provide visual feedback that communicate and enhance the brand to the users, as well as allow for easier navigation of the site by getting to the areas of the page that matter most to the user. This project challenged my skills in coding languages that I was already familiar with: <span>HTML</span>, <span>CSS</span>, and <span>JavaScript</span>, and allowed me to expand my knowledge in each area, while teaching me different techniques for communicating design ideas.</p>
